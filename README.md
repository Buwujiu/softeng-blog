We are using `kramdown` markdown converter. You can find out more about it here [kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org). We highly recommend going through its syntax documentation 
to get yourself more familiar with the coding style. 

##### Images

Images can be added as an absolute or a relative link. You can look at kramdown syntax documentation to find out about adding absolute links. For a relative link images you can upload them into your folder inside images directory `/images/firstname_lastname/image.png`

To refer them inside your blog post, use the image url from the site config as `{{ site.urlimg }}` and append relative link of your image. `{{ site.urlimg }}/firstname_lastname/image.png`

### Update blog content (non-posts)

Blog data (projects, team members, positions, ...) are located in `/_data/`, please edit those files in your own branch and submit pull requests towards gh-pages.
