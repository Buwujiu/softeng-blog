## Introduction
The fields of Cancer Research and Human Genomics while presenting some very hard and interesting problems that touch the domains of Computer Science and Software Engineering do not always have the resources to aquire or use the latest and greatest software tools. In particular it can be really difficult to justify such expenditures. 

However, the kind folks at JetBrains were nice enough to support our development in these important fields, so as a thank you we want to talk about what gets us so excited about using their tools. Choosing the right tools can significantly improve developer quality of life as well as productivity and we want to talk about the JetBrains tools that we love that do just that. 

## IntelliJ IDEA

IntelliJ is a very intuitive, robust, and dare I say it, enjoyable way of programming in Java. Both the community and Ultimate version include many features that accelerate the process of developing our software. While much of the appeal of IntelliJ is, as the cliche goes, that it just works, we highlight a few life-enhancing features that our team takes advantage of or is aided by. 

### Duplicate Detection 

IntelliJ can detect copy-and-paste code that someone lazily (cough) added into the code-base and allows you to quickly navigate between duplicates.

## Smart Quick Fixes

IntelliJ can highlight areas that are potentially buggy or just non-optimal. A particularly nice touch is that pressing `Alt-Enter` will present a large number of context-sensitive options for fixing things. These options can range from suggesting a fix (that can be applied file or project wide), suggested improved code, annotations for hiding false positives, and configuring the check itself.

## Context-sensitive Plugin Suggestion 

So you're starting a new project or reinstalling your system. You open up a new file and IntelliJ suggests useful plugins which let IntelliJ understand types of code:

</figure> 

It's a small touch, but appreciated. 

## Code-style Importing 

So you like IntelliJ but your team likes Eclipse. Or vice versa. Keep things in sync and reduce un-necessary or distracting formatting challenges by taking advantage of IntelliJ's ability to import code formatting files from Eclipse, from CheckStyle, or from other IntelliJ installs. 


## Intuitive Debugging 

While debugging, an intuitive interface allows you to quickly inspect variable values.

Note the display of variables in-line with code and displayed via tool-tips.

## PyCharm

While most IDEs, editors, and tools usually face stiff competition or viable alternatives, few stand head and shoulders above the competition in the way PyCharm does. From writing small scripts, to command line tools, to full fledged web applications, if your weapon of choice is Python, PyCharm will empower development like no other. 

A lot of the features mentioned in the previous section about IntelliJ hold true for PyCharm. You can expect goodies like excellent debugging support and great plugins.

### Virtualenv

When writing Python applications it is essential to manage your dependencies in a way that isolates them from your system as well as making them reproducable. The canonical way of doing this is by creating isolated Python environments using Virtualenv. 

PyCharm provides excellent support for creating, managing, and using your environments. At project creation you can choose to create a new environement or should you have an existing one already you can have PyCharm use that one. You can of course swap and create these enviroments for existing projects too.

    <img src="{{site.urlimg}}dusan_andric/jetbrains/virtualenv.png" />

</figure> 

The UI, in addition to showing your dependencies in a concise way, also displays possible updates and allows you to search for additional packages found in PyPI or any other repository you may have configured. 

### PEP8 and Style

PyCharm will continuously monitor your code style to make sure it adheres to the PEP8 style guide for Python. You can of course configure additional style rules and enforments, such as when to line break around parentheses and braces for example.


### Frameworks

The framework support provided by PyCharm, in particular web frameworks, is simply best in class. If you are looking creating a Django webapp serving Jinja2 templates or a small Flask app with a React SPA for a front-end, PyCharm is your one stop shop for everything. Need to access a MySQL instance or manage a docker deployment? PyCharm will still have you covered.

    <img src="{{site.urlimg}}dusan_andric/jetbrains/pycharm_runconfigs.png" />
    <figcaption>All the default supported run configurations should speak for itself.</figcaption>
</figure> 

You can debug and trace your execution not just through your back-end Python code, but also through your front-end UI code. Having done a considerable amount of full-stack development, having full support for the latest JavaScript and TypeScript is a huge bonus.

#### Django

A special mention is needed for the support provided for Django projects. Just to quickly list a few of the benefits:

* Project structure awareness
* Code Completion for tags, templates, and views
* Django documentation
* Comprehension of routing and settings specific to Django
* Template comprehension and debugging
* manage.py integration

To be perfectly honest, I do not want think about working on large Django projects without PyCharm.

## WebStorm

## DataGrip
