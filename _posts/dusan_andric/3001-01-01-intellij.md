## Introduction
Add into here.

## IntelliJ IDEA

IntelliJ is a very intuitive, robust, and dare I say it, enjoyable way of programming in Java. Both the community and Ultimate version include many features that accelerate the process of developing our software. While much of the appeal of IntelliJ is, as the cliche goes, that it just works, we highlight a few life-enhancing features that our team takes advantage of or is aided by. 

### Duplicate Detection 

IntelliJ can detect copy-and-paste code that someone lazily (cough) added into the code-base and allows you to quickly navigate between duplicates.

## Smart Quick Fixes

IntelliJ can highlight areas that are potentially buggy or just non-optimal. A particularly nice touch is that pressing `Alt-Enter` will present a large number of context-sensitive options for fixing things. These options can range from suggesting a fix (that can be applied file or project wide), suggested improved code, annotations for hiding false positives, and configuring the check itself.

## Context-sensitive Plugin Suggestion 

So you're starting a new project or reinstalling your system. You open up a new file and IntelliJ suggests useful plugins which let IntelliJ understand types of code:

It's a small touch, but appreciated. 

## Code-style Importing 

So you like IntelliJ but your team likes Eclipse. Or vice versa. Keep things in sync and reduce un-necessary or distracting formatting challenges by taking advantage of IntelliJ's ability to import code formatting files from Eclipse, from CheckStyle, or from other IntelliJ installs. 


## Intuitive Debugging 

While debugging, an intuitive interface allows you to quickly inspect variable values.

Note the display of variables in-line with code and displayed via tool-tips.

## PyCharm

While most IDEs, editors, and tools usually face stiff competition or viable alternatives, few stand head and shoulders above the competition in the way PyCharm does. From writing small scripts, to command line tools, to full fledged web applications, if your weapon of choice is Python, PyCharm will empower development like no other. 

A lot of the features mentioned in the previous section about IntelliJ hold true for PyCharm. You can expect the goodies like excellent debugging support and great plugins.

### Virtualenv

When writing Python applications it is essential to manage your dependencies in a way that isolates them from your system as well as making them reproducable. The canonical way of doing this is by creating isolated Python environments using Virtualenv. 

PyCharm provides excellent support for creating, managing, and using your environments. At project creation you can choose to create a new environement or should you have an existing one already you can have PyCharm use that one. You can of course swap and create these enviroments for existing projects too.

</figure> 

The UI, in addition to showing your dependencies in a consise way, also shows you possible uprades and allows you to search for additional packages found in PyPI or any other repository you may have configured. 

### PEP8 and Style

PyCharm will continuously monitor your code style to make sure it adheres to the PEP8 style guide for Python. You can of course configure additional style rules and enforments, such as when to line break around parentheses and braces. 


### Frameworks

The framework support provided by PyCharm, in particular web frameworks, is simply best in class. If you are looking creating a Django webapp serving Jinja2 templates or a small Flask app with a React SPA for a front-end, PyCharm is your one stop shop for everything. Need to access a MySQL instance or manage a docker deployment, PyCharm will still have you covered.

You can debug and trace your execution not just through your back-end Python code, but also through your UI code. With support fo the latest JavaScript as well as CoffeeScript and TypeScript, PyCharm is more than ready to help the fullstack developer tackle any problem.
