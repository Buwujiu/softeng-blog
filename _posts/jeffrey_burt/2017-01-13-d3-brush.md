    info: D3 is a popular javascript library for data visualizations. Last year they released version 4, which had a significant rewrite of the API. This introduced a problem for us because we had one project using D3 v3 and another project using d3 v4. These two projects shared some code and therefore we needed to be able to support both versions of D3 depending on which one was available.

D3 is a popular javascript library for data visualizations. Last year they released version 4, which had a significant rewrite of the API. This introduced a problem for us because we had one project using D3 v3 and another project using d3 v4. These two projects shared some code and therefore we needed to be able to support both versions of D3 depending on which one was available.  

## Detecting current version
Detecting which version of d3 is being used is the easy part.

#### Method 1
Check the value of `d3.version`
```javascript
// we use split instead of `d3.version.charAt(0)` to avoid a windows 9 like situation.
var majorVersion = d3.version.split('.')[0];
if(majorVersion === '3') {
    // version 3 code
} else if(majorVersion === '4') {
    // version 4 code
} else {
    // Are you from the future?
}
```

#### Method 2
Because the API has changed so much, in a lot of cases you can simply check for the existence of the methods you need.

For example, if the v3 method you need is `d3.scale.linear` and the v4 one is `d3.scaleLinear` you could do
```javascript
var scaleLinear = d3.scaleLinear || d3.scale.linear;
```

and then call `scaleLinear` where ever it's needed.

## Using the brush
The biggest change we had to make was where we were using the brush for zooming  

<img src="/images/jeffrey_burt/brush-selection.gif" alt="brush-selection" style="max-width: 320px;"/>

### Version 3 code
```javascript
function brushed(selection) {
    // handle selection
}

var brush = d3.svg.brush()
    .x(d3.scale.linear().range([0, width]))
    .on('brushend', function brushend() {
        var extent = brush.extent();
        wrapper.select('.brush').call(brush.clear());
        brushed(extent);
    });
```

To get this to work there were a few changes that needed to be made.  
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Version 3</th>
        <th>Version 4</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>d3.svg.brush()</td>
        <td>d3.brushX()</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>brush.x(d3.scale.linear().range([0, width]))</td>
        <td>brush.extent([[0, 0], [width, height]])</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>brush.extent()</td>
        <td>d3.event.selection</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>brush.on('brushend', func)</td>
        <td>brush.on('end', func)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>wrapper.select('.brush').call(brush.clear())</td>
        <td>wrapper.select('.brush').call(brush.move, null)</td>
    </tr>
</table>

Because v4 removed the `brush.clear` method, we had to replaced it with a `brush.move` call to `null`  

This introduces another issue. The `brush.clear` method would not fire the `brushend` event, which meant it was fine to call it inside the `brushend` handler itself.
Now that we were using the `brush.move` method, it would fire the `end` event and therefore cause a loop. To solve this we check `d3.event.selection`, If there is nothing there, return.

### Version 4 code
```javascript
function brushed(selection) {
    // handle selection
}

var brush = d3.brushX()
    .extent([[0, 0], [width, height]])
    .on('end', function() {
        var selection = d3.event.selection;
        if (!selection) return;
        wrapper.select('.brush').call(brush.move, null);
        brushed(selection);
    });
```

## Complete code
```javascript
function brushed(selection) {
    // handle selection
}

if(d3.svg) {
    var brush = d3.svg.brush()
        .x(d3.scale.linear().range([0, width]))
        .on('brushend', function brushend() {
            var extent = brush.extent();
            wrapper.select('.brush').call(brush.clear());
            brushed(extent);
        });
} else {
    var brush = d3.brushX()
        .extent([[0, 0], [width, height]])
        .on('end', function() {
            var selection = d3.event.selection;
            if (!selection) return;
            wrapper.select('.brush').call(brush.move, null);
            brushed(selection);
        });
}

```


## Some other api changes
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Version 3</th>
        <th>Version 4</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>d3.svg.axis().scale(x).orient('bottom')</td>
        <td>d3.axisBottom().scale(x)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>d3.svg.area().interpolate('step-before')</td>
        <td>d3.area().curve(d3.curveStepBefore)</td>
    </tr>
</table>


## More information
If you need to use more function across both versions, <https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/master/CHANGES.md> has a lot of useful information you can use to figure out what is required.
